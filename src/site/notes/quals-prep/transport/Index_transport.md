## 1. Big picture and tools

- [[quals-prep/transport/Trans_01_Overview_and_Tools\|Trans_01_Overview_and_Tools]]  
  - Conservation of mass, momentum, energy in words  
  - Shell balance idea (momentum, heat, mass)  
  - Dimensionless groups: Re, Pr, Sc, Nu, Sh  

## 2. Fluid flow and momentum transfer

- [[quals-prep/transport/Trans_02_Momentum_Transport\|Trans_02_Momentum_Transport]]  
  - Newtonian fluids, viscosity  
  - Laminar flow in a pipe (velocity profile, pressure drop)  
  - Friction factor and major/minor losses  
  - Very brief: external flow and drag coefficients 
- [[quals-prep/transport/z_Surface_Tension\|z_Surface_Tension]]

## 3. Heat transfer

- [[quals-prep/transport/Trans_03_Heat_Transfer\|Trans_03_Heat_Transfer]]  
  - Conduction: Fourier’s law, simple 1D wall/cylinder problems  
  - Thermal resistance network idea (lumping layers)  
  - Convection: Newton’s law of cooling, typical Nu correlations (pipe flow, flat plate)  
  - Boiling/condensation only at the level needed for common exam problems  

## 4. Mass transfer

- [[quals-prep/transport/Trans_04_Mass_Transfer\|Trans_04_Mass_Transfer]]  
  - Fick’s law, steady diffusion through a stagnant film  
  - Concept of mass transfer coefficient k_c and flux N_A  
  - Sherwood, Schmidt, Reynolds numbers  
  - Gas–liquid and liquid–solid film transfer (simple correlations)  

## 5. Simultaneous transport and reactors

- [[quals-prep/transport/Trans_05_Transport_in_Reacting_Systems\|Trans_05_Transport_in_Reacting_Systems]]  
  - External mass transfer limitations (film around catalyst particle)  
  - Internal diffusion limitations (concept of effectiveness factor, no heavy derivations unless needed)  
  - Hot spots and heat transfer in exothermic reactors (qualitative plus one simple energy balance)  

## 6. Links to thermo and kinetics

- [[quals-prep/transport/Trans_06_Links_to_Thermo_and_Kinetics\|Trans_06_Links_to_Thermo_and_Kinetics]]  
  - Transport vs thermodynamic driving forces  
  - Diffusion-controlled vs reaction-controlled regimes  
  - Using dimensionless groups (Bi, Da) to classify behavior
