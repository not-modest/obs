## Key definitions

- **Energy balance (reactor)**  
  Conservation of energy including enthalpy in/out, heat of reaction, and heat exchange with surroundings.

- **Adiabatic reactor**  
  No heat exchange with surroundings ($Q = 0$); temperature changes only due to reaction and sensible heating/cooling of the feed.

- **Non‑adiabatic reactor**  
  Heat is added or removed through walls or coils; $Q \neq 0$.

- **Heat of reaction, $\Delta H_r$**  
  Enthalpy change per mole of reaction, usually at a reference temperature; $\Delta H_r < 0$ for exothermic reactions.

- **Heat removal / heat transfer term**  
  Often written as $Q = U A (T_c - T)$ or $U A (T - T_c)$, relating reactor temperature $T$ to coolant temperature $T_c$.

- **Multiple steady states (CSTR)**  
  When coupled mass and energy balances have more than one steady‑state solution for the same operating conditions.

- **Ignition and extinction points**  
  Turning points on heat‑generated vs heat‑removed curves where steady states appear or disappear, leading to jumps in reactor temperature.

## Core formulas (single liquid reaction, constant $C_p$, molar flow $F$)

### 1. CSTR: mass and energy balances

- **Mass balance (species A, steady state)**
  $$
  F_{A0} - F_A + r_A V = 0
  $$

- **Energy balance (one inlet, one outlet)**
  $$
  F C_p (T_0 - T) + (-\Delta H_r)\, r_A V + Q = 0
  $$
  with
  $$
  Q = U A (T_c - T)
  $$
  for cooling.

- **Adiabatic CSTR** ($Q = 0$)
  $$
  F C_p (T_0 - T) + (-\Delta H_r)\, r_A V = 0
  $$

### 2. PFR: differential balances

- **Mass balance (species A)**
  $$
  \frac{dF_A}{dV} = r_A
  $$

- **Energy balance (general)**
  $$
  F C_p \frac{dT}{dV} + (-\Delta H_r)\, r_A + \frac{dQ}{dV} = 0
  $$

  For uniform heat transfer along the reactor:
  $$
  \frac{dQ}{dV} = \frac{U A}{V}\,(T_c - T)
  $$

- **Adiabatic PFR**
  $$
  F C_p \frac{dT}{dV} + (-\Delta H_r)\, r_A = 0
  $$

### 3. Heat generated vs heat removed (CSTR picture)

- **Heat generated by reaction**
  $$
  Q_{\text{gen}} = (-\Delta H_r)\, r_A V
  $$

- **Heat removed by cooling**
  $$
  Q_{\text{rem}} = U A (T - T_c)
  $$

Steady states satisfy $Q_{\text{gen}} = Q_{\text{rem}}$ together with the mass balance.

## Interesting concepts

- **Coupled nonlinearity**  
  Temperature affects the rate via $k(T)$ in $r_A(T)$, and reaction affects temperature via $(-\Delta H_r)$, so mass and energy balances must be solved together; small parameter changes can cause large changes in $T$ and $X$.

- **Hot spots and runaway (PFR)**  
  In exothermic PFRs with limited heat removal, temperature can peak inside the reactor (“hot spot”); if heat generation outpaces removal, thermal runaway can occur.

- **Multiple steady states in CSTRs**  
  For strongly exothermic reactions with cooling, heat‑generated and heat‑removed curves can intersect three times; the middle steady state is unstable (ignition/extinction behavior).

- **Design levers**  
  Adjusting $T_c$, $U$, $A$, feed temperature $T_0$, or feed concentration changes the balance between heat generation and removal and can eliminate runaway or multiple steady states.
