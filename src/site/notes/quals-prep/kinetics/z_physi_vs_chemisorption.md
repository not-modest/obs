|Aspect|Physisorption|Chemisorption|
|---|---|---|
|Nature of interaction|Weak van der Waals forces|Strong chemical bonding (covalent/ionic/metallic)|
|Typical adsorption enthalpy|Low, ~5–40 kJ/mol|High, ~40–400 kJ/mol|
|Bond character|Non-specific, non-directional|Specific, directional (site- and orbital-dependent)|
|Reversibility|Easily reversible (desorbs with mild heating)|Often irreversible or requires significant energy|
|Monolayer vs multilayer|Can form multi-layers (e.g., BET isotherm)|Essentially monolayer (one layer at reactive sites)|
|Activation energy|Usually negligible (can occur at low T)|Often requires activation energy (needs higher T)|
|Temperature dependence|Decreases strongly with increasing T|Often increases with T up to a point (activation), then decreases as desorption dominates|
|Saturation behavior|No sharp saturation; capacity increases gradually|Saturates when reactive sites are occupied|
|Specificity to adsorbent|Low; similar behavior on many surfaces|High; depends on surface chemistry and crystallography|
|Effect on electronic state|Minimal change in adsorbate electronic structure|Significant modification (charge transfer, new states)|
|Role in catalysis|Typically pre-coverage or weak pre-adsorption|Central to heterogeneous catalysis (reactive intermediates)|
|Typical examples|Adsorption of noble gases, N₂ on many solids at low T|H₂, CO, O₂, small organics on metal catalysts|
