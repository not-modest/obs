## Key definitions

- **Thermodynamic system**  
  Region of space chosen for analysis. Everything else is surroundings. Boundary separates system from surroundings.

- **Types of systems**  
  - Closed system: no mass crosses boundary; energy may cross.  
  - Open system (control volume): mass and energy may cross.  
  - Isolated system: no mass or energy crosses boundary.

- **State of a system**  
  Condition described by a set of macroscopic properties (e.g. $T, P, V, n$, composition) sufficient to determine all other properties.

- **State function**  
  Property depending only on current state, not on path (e.g. $U, H, S, G, T, P, V$).

- **Path function**  
  Quantity depending on process path, not a property of the state (e.g. heat $Q$, work $W$).

- **Intensive vs extensive**  
  - Intensive: independent of system size (e.g. $T, P, \rho$).  
  - Extensive: proportional to system size (e.g. $U, V, H, S$, total mass).  
  Specific or molar quantities are extensive divided by mass or moles.

- **Simple compressible system**  
  System where only $P$–$V$ work is relevant (no electric, magnetic, surface, or other work modes).

## Core relations and concepts

- **Thermodynamic equilibrium**  
  No net driving forces for change; mechanical, thermal, and chemical equilibria satisfied.

- **Quasi‑equilibrium (quasi‑static) process**  
  Process carried out infinitely slowly so the system passes through a sequence of equilibrium states.

- **Thermodynamic diagrams (common)**  
  - $P$–$V$, $T$–$S$, $H$–$S$ (Mollier), phase diagrams ($P$–$T$).  
  Used to visualize processes, cycles, and property changes.

- **Additivity of extensive properties**  
  For non‑interacting subsystems:
  $$
  U = \sum_i U_i,\quad S = \sum_i S_i,\quad V = \sum_i V_i
  $$

## Interesting concepts

- **Systems possess energy, not heat or work**  
  $U$, $H$, etc. are properties; $Q$ and $W$ are modes of energy transfer during a process.

- **Choice of state variables**  
  For simple compressible systems, two independent intensive properties (e.g. $T$ and $P$ or $T$ and $v$) fix the state for a single phase.

- **Reference states**  
  Absolute values of many properties (e.g. $U$, $H$) are defined relative to a chosen reference; only differences matter physically.
