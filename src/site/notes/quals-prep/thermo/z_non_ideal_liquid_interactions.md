# Non-Ideal Liquid Interactions – VLE Implications
#2019_Jan  [[quals-prep/thermo/z_Raoult's_Law\|z_Raoult's_Law]]
## 1. Types of Non-Ideal Interactions

### Positive Deviations from Raoult's Law (Repulsive)
- **A–A and B–B interactions stronger** than A–B interactions.  
- Molecules prefer their "own kind" → **less favorable mixing**.  
- **Excess Gibbs energy** $G^E > 0$.  
- **Activity coefficients** $\gamma_i > 1$.  

### Negative Deviations from Raoult's Law (Attractive)
- **A–B interactions stronger** than A–A or B–B.  
- Molecules prefer mixing → **more favorable mixing**.  
- **Excess Gibbs energy** $G^E < 0$.  
- **Activity coefficients** $\gamma_i < 1$.

## 2. Thermodynamic Consequences

**Modified Raoult's law:**
$$
p_i = \gamma_i x_i P_i^{\text{sat}}(T)
$$

### Positive deviations ($\gamma_i > 1$):
Total P > ideal mixture P  
Bubble/dew curves pinch toward azeotrope → MINIMUM BOILING AZEOTROPE
- Higher vapor pressures → **minimum-boiling azeotropes**.  
- Azeotrope composition has **lowest boiling point** in system.

### Negative deviations ($\gamma_i < 1$):
Total P < ideal mixture P  
Bubble/dew curves bulge away → MAXIMUM BOILING AZEOTROPE
- Lower vapor pressures → **maximum-boiling azeotropes**.  
- Azeotrope composition has **highest boiling point** in system.

## 3. Excess Properties Summary

| Deviation Type | $G^E$ | $\gamma_i$ | Total P | Azeotrope Type | Boiling Point |
|----------------|-------|------------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Positive       | > 0   | > 1        | > ideal | Min-boiling    | Lowest        |
| Ideal          | 0     | = 1        | = ideal | None           | Linear        |
| Negative       | < 0   | < 1        | < ideal | Max-boiling    | Highest       |

## 4. Practical Implications

- **Distillation limitations**: Azeotropes create **pinch points**; cannot cross azeotrope composition by simple distillation.
- **Process intensification**: Reactive distillation, extractive distillation, pressure-swing distillation to break azeotropes.
- **Solvent selection**: Match molecular similarity (similar $\gamma_i \approx 1$) or exploit non-ideality for separation.

**Rule of thumb**: "Like dissolves like" → ideal or negative deviations; dissimilar molecules → positive deviations and potential azeotropy.
